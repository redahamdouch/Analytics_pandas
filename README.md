# Analytics with Pandas
- I realized this project during my M2 in order to learn how to handle Python and particularly Pandas in order to pre-process data and analyze them 
- This project aims to manipulate a dataset for analytical purposes. The objective is to answer some analytical questions which requires a work of preprocessing, cleaning, manipulation, conversion, visualization of data
- I mainly used Pandas but also other packages and modules.




- In this dataset there are four worksheets:
    - COMPANY: firmographics
    - INVESTMENT: relevant investments received by the companies
    - ACQUISITION: relevant acquisitions the companies have
    - EMPLOYEE: relevant employees working in the companies

- To help you better understand the datasets, data dictionaries are given below.
